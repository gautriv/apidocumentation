      - question: "What exactly is an API and why is it important?"
        answer: "An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It works like a waiter in a restaurant, taking requests from clients and delivering responses from servers. APIs are important because they enable seamless integration between different systems, allow developers to leverage existing services without rebuilding them, and facilitate the development of modern digital ecosystems."
        
      - question: "What's the difference between public, private, and partner APIs?"
        answer: "Public APIs (open APIs) are available for any developer to use, typically with minimal restrictions. Private APIs are for internal use only within an organization, enhancing internal systems and workflows. Partner APIs are shared with specific business partners under formal agreements. Each type has different security, documentation, and access control needs based on its intended audience."
        
      - question: "How do API keys work and why are they used?"
        answer: "API keys are unique identifier strings assigned to applications or developers that want to use an API. They work like digital passes, authenticating the requester and tracking usage. API keys are used to control access, implement rate limiting, monitor who is using the API and how often, and in some cases to enable monetization through usage-based billing. However, they should not be used alone for securing sensitive operations as they can be intercepted."
        
      - question: "What are the main components of an API request and response?"
        answer: "An API request typically includes: an endpoint (URL), HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), headers (metadata like authentication credentials and content type), and sometimes a request body (data being sent). An API response includes: a status code (indicating success or failure), headers (metadata about the response), and a response body (requested data, usually in JSON or XML format)."

    items:
      - question: "What should I consider when designing an API?"
        answer: "When designing an API, consider: 1) User experience (intuitive endpoints and parameters), 2) Consistency (naming conventions, error handling), 3) Security (authentication, authorization, data validation), 4) Performance (caching, pagination, efficient responses), 5) Versioning strategy, 6) Documentation quality, 7) Rate limiting and quotas, and 8) Adherence to standards like REST or GraphQL principles. Always design with your API consumers in mind."
        
      - question: "How do I version my API properly?"
        answer: "Proper API versioning strategies include: 1) URL path versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/resource`), 2) Query parameter versioning (e.g., `/api/resource?version=1`), 3) Custom header versioning (e.g., `X-API-Version: 1`), or 4) Accept header versioning (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.company.v1+json`). Choose one approach and be consistent. Never make breaking changes without version increments, and consider maintaining older versions for a deprecation period."
        
      - question: "What's the difference between authentication and authorization in APIs?"
        answer: "Authentication verifies who you are (identity), while authorization determines what you're allowed to do (permissions). In API contexts, authentication might involve API keys, OAuth tokens, or JWT, verifying the client's identity. Authorization happens after authentication and controls what resources or operations that authenticated client can access, often using role-based or attribute-based access control systems."
        
      - question: "How should I handle API rate limiting?"
        answer: "For API rate limiting: 1) Implement tiered limits based on user types, 2) Return clear rate limit information in headers (remaining requests, reset time), 3) Return 429 (Too Many Requests) status code when limits are exceeded, 4) Include clear documentation about rate limits, 5) Consider gradual throttling rather than hard cutoffs, and 6) Provide mechanisms for premium users to request higher limits. Always include a clear retry-after header when limiting requests."
        
  - name: "API Usage"
    items:
      - question: "What's the best way to learn how to use a new API?"
        answer: "To learn a new API: 1) Start with the official documentation to understand core concepts, authentication, and available endpoints, 2) Explore interactive examples or tutorials if available, 3) Test simple requests using tools like Postman or cURL, 4) Join the API's community forums or Stack Overflow to see common questions, 5) Examine SDK/code samples in your preferred language, and 6) Build a small prototype project to get hands-on experience. Many APIs also offer sandbox environments for safe testing."
        
      - question: "How do I troubleshoot API errors effectively?"
        answer: "To troubleshoot API errors: 1) Examine the HTTP status code and error message, 2) Check request parameters and headers for correctness, 3) Verify your authentication credentials, 4) Look for rate limiting or quota issues, 5) Test the endpoint with tools like Postman to isolate the problem, 6) Check the API's status page for service disruptions, 7) Inspect the API documentation for parameter requirements, and 8) Review server logs if you have access. Most API providers include detailed error messages to help pinpoint issues."
        
      - question: "What tools should I use for testing APIs?"
        answer: "Essential API testing tools include: 1) Postman or Insomnia for interactive request building and testing, 2) cURL for command-line requests, 3) Swagger UI for exploring OpenAPI-documented APIs, 4) JMeter or k6 for load testing, 5) Mocha, Jest, or other testing frameworks for automated tests, 6) Charles Proxy or Fiddler for inspecting API traffic, and 7) CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions for continuous API testing. The best approach combines manual exploration with automated testing."
        
      - question: "How do I keep up with API changes and deprecations?"
        answer: "To stay updated on API changes: 1) Subscribe to the API provider's developer newsletter, 2) Follow their developer blog or changelog, 3) Join their developer forum or community, 4) Follow the provider on social media or GitHub, 5) Set up monitoring for deprecation headers in API responses, 6) Regularly review API documentation for updates, and 7) Implement automated tests that could catch breaking changes. Many providers also offer deprecation notices with timeframes for migration."
