  - name: "Data Type Basics"
    items:
      - question: "What are data types in the context of APIs?"
        answer: "Data types in APIs are classifications that define what kind of value a variable can hold. Common API data types include Boolean, String, Number, List/Array, Date/Time, and Enum. Understanding data types is essential for properly formatting API requests and interpreting responses."
      
      - question: "Why is visualizing data types important in API documentation?"
        answer: "Visualizing data types helps bridge the gap between abstract programming concepts and user understanding. It makes documentation more accessible, especially for visual learners and non-developers. Effective visualization can reduce misunderstandings, improve developer experience, and speed up API integration."
      
      - question: "How do data types relate to JSON and XML in API responses?"
        answer: "JSON and XML are data interchange formats that represent the various data types in structured ways. In JSON, data types are represented as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, or null. XML similarly represents these types but uses elements, attributes, and specific formatting. Understanding these representations is crucial for parsing API responses correctly."

  - name: "Visualization Techniques"
    items:
      - question: "What are the best UI elements for representing Boolean data types?"
        answer: "Boolean data types (true/false) are most effectively visualized using checkboxes or toggle switches. Checkboxes are universally recognized—checked for true, unchecked for false. Toggle switches provide a more modern interface with a clear on/off visual representation."
      
      - question: "How should String data types be visualized in user interfaces?"
        answer: "String data types are best represented with text input fields. Single-line text fields work well for short inputs like names or IDs, while multi-line text areas are appropriate for longer text like descriptions or comments. The field size should visually suggest the expected length."
      
      - question: "What UI components work best for Number data types?"
        answer: "Number data types can be effectively visualized with numeric steppers (with increment/decrement buttons), sliders for value ranges, or specialized number input fields. For finite ranges, sliders provide visual feedback about where a value sits within the possible range."
      
      - question: "How can List/Array data types be effectively displayed?"
        answer: "Lists or Arrays are typically visualized using dropdown menus, multi-select boxes, or a series of checkboxes. For ordered lists, numbered items or drag-and-drop interfaces can emphasize the sequence. Tags or chips work well for displaying multiple selected items in a compact form."

  - name: "Special Data Types"
    items:
      - question: "What are the best practices for visualizing Date and Time data types?"
        answer: "Date and Time data types are best represented with calendar pickers and time selectors. These provide a user-friendly way to input standardized date formats without requiring users to remember specific formatting rules. For recurring dates, specialized UI components like date range pickers or schedule selectors may be more appropriate."
      
      - question: "How should Enum (enumeration) data types be displayed in UI?"
        answer: "Enum data types work best with radio buttons (for few options) or dropdown menus (for many options). These UI elements make it clear that only one option can be selected from a predefined set of values. Color-coding or icons can enhance the visual distinction between options."
      
      - question: "What visualization techniques work for complex or nested data structures?"
        answer: "Complex or nested data structures can be visualized using expandable/collapsible sections, tree views, or tabbed interfaces. Interactive JSON/XML viewers with syntax highlighting and collapsible nodes help users navigate and understand the hierarchy of nested data. Visual diagrams showing relationships between data elements can also be helpful."

  - name: "Implementation Considerations"
    items:
      - question: "How do data type visualizations change across different devices and screen sizes?"
        answer: "Responsive design principles apply to data type visualizations. On smaller screens, certain elements may need to adapt—dropdown menus might replace radio buttons, date pickers may simplify, and complex visualizations might require progressive disclosure. Always test visualizations across various device sizes to ensure usability."
      
      - question: "What accessibility considerations should be made when visualizing data types?"
        answer: "Accessibility is crucial for data type visualizations. Ensure proper contrast, support keyboard navigation, provide text alternatives for visual elements, use ARIA labels, and ensure screen reader compatibility. Form elements should have clear labels and error messaging. Follow WCAG guidelines to make visualizations accessible to all users."
      
      - question: "How can design systems standardize data type visualizations?"
        answer: "Design systems can create consistent component libraries with standardized UI elements for each data type. This ensures consistency across an API platform and speeds up documentation creation. The system should include guidelines for when to use each visualization type, along with code snippets or components that can be easily implemented."
