  - name: "REST API Fundamentals"
    items:
      - question: "What is a REST API and how does it work?"
        answer: "REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. A REST API works by using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform operations on resources identified by URLs. Each resource is represented as a unique URL, and the HTTP method determines the action to perform on that resource. REST is stateless, meaning each request contains all the information needed to process it, and client-server communication occurs through standard HTTP requests and responses, typically using JSON or XML data formats."

      - question: "What are the key principles of REST architecture?"
        answer: "The key principles of REST architecture include: 1) Statelessness - each request must contain all information needed, with no client context stored on the server; 2) Uniform Interface - resources are identified by URIs and manipulated through standard HTTP methods; 3) Client-Server separation - clients and servers evolve independently; 4) Cacheable - responses must define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable; 5) Layered System - intermediary servers can improve scalability; and 6) Code on Demand (optional) - servers can temporarily extend client functionality by transferring executable code."

      - question: "What documentation elements are essential for REST APIs?"
        answer: "Essential documentation elements for REST APIs include: 1) Resource descriptions with clear URI patterns and examples; 2) HTTP methods supported for each resource; 3) Request parameters, headers, and body schemas with data types and constraints; 4) Response formats with status codes, headers, and body schemas; 5) Authentication and authorization requirements; 6) Error responses and handling; 7) Rate limiting policies; 8) Pagination mechanisms; 9) Working code examples in multiple languages; 10) Versioning information; and 11) Interactive API explorers when possible. Technical writers should focus on organizing this information logically by resource rather than by endpoint to improve usability."

  - name: "SOAP API Fundamentals"
    items:
      - question: "What is a SOAP API and how does it differ from REST?"
        answer: "SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information using XML. Unlike REST which is an architectural style, SOAP is a formal protocol with strict standards. Key differences include: 1) SOAP uses XML exclusively while REST supports multiple formats like JSON; 2) SOAP typically operates over HTTP but can use other protocols like SMTP, while REST uses HTTP/HTTPS; 3) SOAP has built-in error handling and security features, while REST relies on the transport protocol; 4) SOAP is more rigid and formalized, while REST is flexible and lightweight; 5) SOAP has higher overhead due to XML parsing and strict messaging structure."

      - question: "What are WSDL and UDDI in the context of SOAP APIs?"
        answer: "WSDL (Web Services Description Language) is an XML-based interface description language that describes the functionality offered by a SOAP web service. It provides a machine-readable description of how the service can be called, what parameters it expects, and what data structures it returns. UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) is a directory service where businesses can register and search for web services in a standardized way. It allows organizations to list their available SOAP services in a registry that can be discovered by others, functioning somewhat like a 'phone book' for web services. Together, they facilitate the discovery and consumption of SOAP web services in enterprise environments."

      - question: "How should technical writers approach SOAP API documentation?"
        answer: "Technical writers documenting SOAP APIs should: 1) Explain the WSDL structure and how to interpret it; 2) Document each operation with its input and output messages, including all elements and types; 3) Provide detailed XML request and response examples for each operation; 4) Explain fault messages and error handling; 5) Document security requirements like WS-Security implementations; 6) Include code samples in multiple languages showing how to consume the SOAP service; 7) Explain any transport protocol considerations; 8) Document header elements and their purposes; 9) Create a glossary of domain-specific terms; and 10) Consider providing tools or guidance for generating client code from the WSDL. Given SOAP's complexity, visual representations of message flows can be particularly valuable."

  - name: "GraphQL API Fundamentals"
    items:
      - question: "What is GraphQL and how does it work?"
        answer: "GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs developed by Facebook. It works by having a single endpoint where clients can request exactly the data they need by specifying a query structure that mirrors the desired response structure. The server processes this query against its schema (which defines available types and fields) and returns only the requested data. Unlike REST, where the server determines the response structure, GraphQL gives clients control over what data they receive. GraphQL has three primary operation types: queries (for fetching data), mutations (for modifying data), and subscriptions (for real-time updates). The server resolves each field in the query independently, allowing for efficient and precise data fetching."

      - question: "What are GraphQL schemas and types?"
        answer: "GraphQL schemas define the capabilities of an API by specifying the types of data that can be queried and how they relate to each other. A schema consists of: 1) Object Types - representing objects with fields (e.g., User, Product); 2) Scalar Types - primitive values like String, Int, Boolean, Float, and ID; 3) Query Type - defining entry points for read operations; 4) Mutation Type - defining entry points for write operations; 5) Subscription Type - defining entry points for real-time operations; 6) Input Types - special object types for arguments; 7) Enum Types - restricted sets of values; 8) Interface and Union Types - for polymorphic results; and 9) Custom Scalar Types for specialized data formats. The schema acts as a contract between client and server, enabling strong typing, validation, and documentation."

      - question: "What are the challenges in documenting GraphQL APIs?"
        answer: "Documenting GraphQL APIs presents unique challenges including: 1) Explaining the conceptual shift from endpoint-based to schema-based thinking; 2) Documenting complex nested relationships between types; 3) Illustrating how to construct efficient queries to avoid performance issues; 4) Explaining pagination patterns and cursor-based approaches; 5) Documenting authentication that applies to the single endpoint; 6) Showing how error handling differs from REST APIs; 7) Explaining directives and their usage; and 8) Documenting schema evolution and deprecation practices. Technical writers should leverage introspection and tools like GraphiQL/GraphQL Playground to provide interactive documentation where users can explore the schema and test queries directly."

  - name: "WebSocket API Fundamentals"
    items:
      - question: "What are WebSockets and how do they differ from HTTP-based APIs?"
        answer: "WebSockets are a communication protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. They differ from HTTP-based APIs (like REST) in several ways: 1) Connection persistence - WebSockets maintain an open connection rather than creating a new connection for each request; 2) Bidirectional communication - both server and client can initiate messages at any time; 3) Real-time capabilities - messages are delivered immediately with minimal latency; 4) Different protocol - WebSockets use the 'ws://' or 'wss://' protocol rather than 'http://' or 'https://'; 5) Message-based rather than request-response based; 6) Lightweight framing with minimal headers after the initial handshake. WebSockets are ideal for applications requiring real-time updates like chat, live dashboards, gaming, and collaborative editing."

      - question: "How do you document WebSocket APIs effectively?"
        answer: "Effective WebSocket API documentation should include: 1) Connection establishment details including any parameters required during handshake; 2) Authentication methods for secure connections; 3) Message formats with clear schemas for each message type; 4) Event types for both client-to-server and server-to-client communication; 5) Connection lifecycle including initialization, heartbeats, and graceful disconnection; 6) Error handling and reconnection strategies; 7) State management considerations; 8) Rate limiting or throttling information; 9) Sequence diagrams showing message flows for common scenarios; 10) Code examples showing connection, message handling, and error recovery; and 11) Any limitations or browser compatibility issues. Since WebSockets are event-driven, organizing documentation around events rather than endpoints is often more intuitive for users."

      - question: "What are common WebSocket API implementation patterns?"
        answer: "Common WebSocket API patterns include: 1) JSON-RPC over WebSockets - using RPC-style method calls with JSON serialization; 2) Event-based messaging - where messages are categorized by event types; 3) Publish/Subscribe - clients subscribe to topics and receive messages published to those topics; 4) Request/Response over WebSockets - maintaining the HTTP-style interaction but over a persistent connection; 5) Binary protocols - using binary formats like Protocol Buffers or MessagePack for efficiency; 6) Hybrid approaches - using REST for CRUD operations and WebSockets for real-time updates. Technical writers should document the chosen pattern clearly, as it significantly impacts how developers will interact with the API."

  - name: "gRPC API Fundamentals"
    items:
      - question: "What is gRPC and how does it work?"
        answer: "gRPC is a high-performance, open-source RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework developed by Google. It uses HTTP/2 for transport and Protocol Buffers as its interface definition language. In gRPC, you define services that specify methods with their parameter and return types in .proto files. These are compiled into client and server code in various languages. When a client calls a remote method, the request is serialized using Protocol Buffers (a binary format), sent to the server, deserialized, and processed. The server then sends a response back using the same process. gRPC supports four types of service methods: unary RPC (single request/response), server streaming RPC, client streaming RPC, and bidirectional streaming RPC, enabling a wide range of communication patterns beyond what's easily possible with REST."

      - question: "What are Protocol Buffers and why are they used in gRPC?"
        answer: "Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. They're used in gRPC for several key reasons: 1) Compact binary format - resulting in smaller payloads (20-100% smaller than JSON) and faster transmission; 2) Schema definition - messages are strongly typed and defined in .proto files; 3) Code generation - automatically generates serialization/deserialization code in multiple languages; 4) Backward/forward compatibility - allows evolving APIs without breaking existing clients through carefully numbered fields; 5) Fast processing - more efficient to encode/decode than text-based formats like JSON or XML; 6) Structured data validation; 7) Built-in documentation through .proto files. Protocol Buffers are particularly valuable in high-throughput systems where performance and bandwidth efficiency are critical concerns."

      - question: "What are the documentation challenges specific to gRPC APIs?"
        answer: "Documenting gRPC APIs presents several unique challenges for technical writers: 1) Explaining Protocol Buffers syntax and concepts to users unfamiliar with IDL (Interface Definition Language); 2) Documenting streaming patterns which differ significantly from request-response models; 3) Explaining generated code usage across multiple programming languages; 4) Documenting interceptors and middleware concepts; 5) Explaining how to test gRPC services (as standard HTTP tools won't work); 6) Documenting error handling with status codes and error details; 7) Explaining RPC concepts to developers familiar only with REST; 8) Documenting authentication implementation which differs from REST APIs. Effective documentation should include annotated .proto files, language-specific examples for all supported languages, and clear explanations of streaming concepts with sequence diagrams."

  - name: "Documentation Best Practices for API Types"
    items:
      - question: "How does API documentation differ between REST, GraphQL, and gRPC?"
        answer: "Documentation approaches vary significantly across API types: REST APIs typically require documenting individual endpoints with their HTTP methods, URL patterns, query parameters, request/response formats, and status codes, often using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications. GraphQL APIs center around documenting the schema (types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions) and can leverage introspection for self-documentation, with tools like GraphiQL providing interactive exploration. gRPC documentation focuses on service definitions and message types in .proto files, with emphasis on streaming patterns and generated client usage. While REST documentation organizes by endpoints, GraphQL by types, and gRPC by services, all benefit from authentication explanations, error handling details, and code examples. The technical writer's approach should adapt to these fundamental structural differences while maintaining clarity and completeness."

      - question: "What are effective strategies for documenting API authentication across different API types?"
        answer: "When documenting API authentication across different types, technical writers should: 1) For REST APIs - explain header-based authentication (like API keys or Bearer tokens), query parameter options, and OAuth flows with clear request examples; 2) For GraphQL - document how authentication applies to the single endpoint, typically through headers, and how to handle authentication errors; 3) For SOAP - detail WS-Security implementations, SAML tokens, and XML signatures with examples; 4) For WebSockets - explain the initial handshake authentication and any session token requirements; 5) For gRPC - document interceptor-based authentication and metadata usage. For all types, include secure credential handling practices, token lifecycle management, permission scopes explanation, and environment-specific considerations (development vs. production). Visual diagrams of authentication flows are particularly valuable for OAuth and other complex mechanisms."

      - question: "How should technical writers approach versioning documentation for different API types?"
        answer: "Technical writers should approach API versioning documentation differently based on the API type: For REST APIs, document the versioning strategy (URL path, query parameter, header, or content negotiation) with clear examples of accessing each version. For GraphQL, focus on schema evolution practices, including how deprecated fields are marked and for how long they'll be supported. For SOAP, document different namespaces or endpoints for each major version and compatibility considerations. For gRPC, explain Protocol Buffer's backward compatibility mechanisms, field numbering importance, and reserved fields. In all cases, clearly document the organization's versioning policy, breaking vs. non-breaking changes, deprecation notices with timelines, migration guides between versions, and version-specific examples. Consider creating separate documentation sets for major versions while maintaining a clear navigation structure between them."
