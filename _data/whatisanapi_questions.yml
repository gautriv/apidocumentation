  options:
    - "GET"
    - "POST"
    - "PUT"
    - "DELETE"
  correct_answer: 0

  options:
    - "Encrypting API responses"
    - "Compressing data"
    - "Authentication and identification of API users"
    - "Formatting response data"
  correct_answer: 2
  explanation: "API keys are primarily used for authentication and identification of API users. They help API providers track and control how their API is being used and by whom."

- question: "What is API rate limiting?"
  options:
    - "A limit on how much data an API can return"
    - "A restriction on how frequently API calls can be made"
    - "A limit on the number of users who can access an API"
    - "A restriction on the types of requests an API can handle"
  correct_answer: 1
  explanation: "API rate limiting is a restriction on how frequently API calls can be made. It helps prevent abuse, ensures fair usage, and maintains the performance and stability of the API service."

- question: "What is API versioning used for?"
  options:
    - "To count how many times an API has been used"
    - "To allow backward compatibility when APIs evolve"
    - "To measure API performance"
    - "To indicate how popular an API is"
  correct_answer: 1
  explanation: "API versioning is used to allow backward compatibility when APIs evolve. It enables developers to make changes to their APIs without breaking existing client applications."

- question: "What is a REST API?"
  options:
    - "A programming language for creating APIs"
    - "A database management system"
    - "An architectural style for designing networked applications"
    - "A security protocol for APIs"
  correct_answer: 2
  explanation: "REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. REST APIs use HTTP requests to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and follow specific principles like statelessness and a uniform interface."

- question: "Which HTTP method is typically used to retrieve data from an API?"
  options:
    - "POST"
    - "PUT"
    - "GET"
    - "DELETE"
  correct_answer: 2
  explanation: "The GET HTTP method is typically used to retrieve data from an API. It requests a specific resource without modifying any data on the server."

- question: "What is an API endpoint?"
  options:
    - "The physical server hosting the API"
    - "A specific URL where an API can be accessed"
    - "The programming language used to create the API"
    - "The company that owns the API"
  correct_answer: 1
  explanation: "An API endpoint is a specific URL where an API can be accessed. Each endpoint represents a specific function or resource that the API provides, and clients interact with the API by making requests to these endpoints."

- question: "What does an API response typically contain?"
  options:
    - "Only status codes"
    - "Only error messages"
    - "Data in a structured format like JSON or XML, along with status codes"
    - "Raw binary data"
  correct_answer: 2
  explanation: "An API response typically contains data in a structured format like JSON or XML, along with HTTP status codes that indicate the result of the request. The response may also include headers with additional metadata."

    - "Web API"
    - "Library-based API"
    - "Database API"
    - "HTML API"
  correct_answer: 3
  explanation: "HTML API is not a common type of API. Common types include Web APIs (like REST and SOAP), Library-based APIs (programming interfaces in software libraries), Database APIs, and Operating System APIs."

- question: "What is a SOAP API?"
  options:
    - "A simplified version of REST APIs"
    - "A protocol for accessing web services using simple HTTP without any structure"
    - "A protocol that uses XML-based messaging for exchanging structured information"
    - "An API specifically designed for mobile applications"
  correct_answer: 2
  explanation: "SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol that uses XML-based messaging for exchanging structured information in web services. SOAP APIs are more rigid and formal than REST APIs, with strict standards and built-in error handling."

- question: "What is the benefit of using APIs in software development?"
  options:
    - "They eliminate the need for databases"
    - "They allow developers to leverage existing services without having to build everything from scratch"
    - "They automatically fix bugs in code"
    - "They make applications run offline"
  correct_answer: 1
  explanation: "A key benefit of using APIs is that they allow developers to leverage existing services without having to build everything from scratch. This promotes code reuse, saves development time, enables integration with third-party services, and helps create more feature-rich applications."
