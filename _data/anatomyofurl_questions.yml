- question: "What are the five main components of a URL?"
  options:
    - "Protocol, path, method, query parameters, headers"
    - "Protocol, domain name, path, query parameters, fragment identifier"
    - "HTTP, domain, directory, file, extension"
    - "Scheme, authentication, host, port, resource"
  correctIndex: 1
  explanation: "A URL consists of five main components: protocol (e.g., https://), domain name (e.g., www.example.com), path (e.g., /search), query parameters (e.g., ?q=term), and fragment identifier (e.g., #section)."

- question: "What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS protocols?"
  options:
    - "HTTP is faster than HTTPS"
    - "HTTP uses GET requests while HTTPS uses POST requests"
    - "HTTP sends data in clear text while HTTPS adds encryption"
    - "HTTP is for web browsing while HTTPS is only for APIs"
  correctIndex: 2
  explanation: "HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure) both facilitate web communication, but HTTPS adds an encryption layer (SSL/TLS) that scrambles the data during transmission, protecting it from unauthorized access. HTTP sends data in clear text, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping."

- question: "What is the purpose of a domain name in a URL?"
  options:
    - "To specify the file format of the requested resource"
    - "To identify the server hosting the website or API"
    - "To indicate which programming language the site uses"
    - "To determine the speed of the connection"
  correctIndex: 1
  explanation: "The domain name is the address of a website on the internet. It is a human-readable name that corresponds to an IP address, which is the actual address of the server hosting the website. Domain names are easier for people to remember than IP addresses."

- question: "Which part of the URL identifies specific resources in a RESTful API?"
  options:
    - "Protocol"
    - "Domain name"
    - "Path"
    - "Fragment identifier"
  correctIndex: 2
  explanation: "In RESTful APIs, the path component of a URL identifies resources or collections. Paths generally identify resources (e.g., /users), use IDs to reference specific items (e.g., /users/123), and follow a hierarchical structure reflecting resource relationships."

- question: "What is the purpose of query parameters in a URL?"
  options:
    - "To encrypt the connection between client and server"
    - "To specify which server to connect to"
    - "To filter, sort, or customize the response data"
    - "To indicate which browser is making the request"
  correctIndex: 2
  explanation: "Query parameters allow you to send additional information to the server. They're used for filtering results, sorting data, pagination, search queries, and controlling response format. They appear after a question mark (?) in the URL and are formatted as key-value pairs."

- question: "How is a fragment identifier differentiated from other URL components?"
  options:
    - "It appears before the query parameters"
    - "It is preceded by a hash sign (#)"
    - "It is enclosed in brackets"
    - "It must be in all capital letters"
  correctIndex: 1
  explanation: "Fragment identifiers are indicated by a hash sign (#) followed by a unique identifier. They typically link to specific sections within a web page or provide deep links to specific resources."

- question: "In which URL component would you find path parameters in a RESTful API?"
  options:
    - "Protocol"
    - "Domain name"
    - "Path"
    - "Query parameters"
  correctIndex: 2
  explanation: "Path parameters are variable parts of the path component. They're usually denoted in documentation with curly braces (e.g., /users/{userId}) and must be replaced with actual values when making requests."

- question: "Which URL component is NOT sent to the server when making a request?"
  options:
    - "Protocol"
    - "Domain name"
    - "Query parameters"
    - "Fragment identifier"
  correctIndex: 3
  explanation: "Fragment identifiers are processed by the browser, not sent to the server. They're used for navigation within a page, implementation of single-page applications, storing application state, and creating bookmarkable views within dynamic applications."
